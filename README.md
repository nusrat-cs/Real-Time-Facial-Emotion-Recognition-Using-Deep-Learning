# Real-Time-Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using Python, computer vision, and deep learning. Trained on the FER-2013 dataset with a CNN model, the system detects faces from images and live webcam video and classifies emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, and Neutral with high accuracy.
