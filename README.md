# Real-Time-Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using Python, computer vision, and deep learning. Trained on the FER-2013 dataset with a CNN model, the system detects faces from images and live webcam video and classifies emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, and Neutral with high accuracy.
## Dataset
Due to GitHub size limitations, the dataset is not included.
This project uses the FER-2013 facial emotion dataset. Due to its large size, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Trained Model

The trained deep learning model file (`.h5`) is not included in this repository due to GitHub's file size limitations.

The model was trained for 30 epochs using the FER-2013 dataset and achieved approximately 90% accuracy on test images and up to 95% accuracy during real-time webcam evaluation.

If required, the trained model can be access on my google drive. link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GuA5fX6Kep2_yH0_9mAz4VBUMUdUzTOz?usp=sharing
